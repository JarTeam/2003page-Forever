	<p>Written by: ChazizPF94! :)</p>
	<h2>How did the project begun</h2>
	<p><img border="0" src="q&a.ht1.png"></p>
	<p>It begun as a idea, after i noticed the &quot;Free frontpage extensions&quot; link 
	XPuser (who left the project almost a year later) sent to me, I asked to him 
	if we can do a frontpage website. A reset was made due to the &quot;Open Site&quot; 
	thing, which added useless metadata that no browsers could read.</p>
	<p>This wasn&#39;t the first time i made one of those &quot;nostalgia&quot; type of sites, 
	I remember making something simillar with Frontpage XP (i think?) in 2018, 
	and i made a project called &quot;Bonzi Revived&quot;, which tried to replicate the 
	original Bonzi Buddy website, These two have been lost due to deletion. 
	Bonzi Revived wasn&#39;t the first site i made, Back in late-2016, Gamerappa.ga 
	was created, It was a somewhat-poorly managed website that went down in 
	late-2017 due to a arguement with me and the server hoster/provider/administrator.</p>
	<h2>Why is 2003page not &quot;2003&quot;-y?</h2>
	<p>This is because the era of late-90s/early-00s has been often revived with 
	sites (Some sites on Neocities for example, and Retrosite as well), i wanted 
	to visit a later era, the mid-to-late-00s (in my words, late-2004 to 
	mid-2009)</p>
